AnyKernelEpic - by zman0900

Inspired by AnyKernel by koush, dump_image binary taken as-is from AnyKernel


Feel free to use this in your own projects and make any changes as you see fit

INSTRUCTIONS:
Build your kernel as usual until you have your zImage and any modules.
Put zImage in zip
Remove any old modules from zip/system/lib/modules and replace with yours
Run build_zip.sh to create flashable zip

HOW IT WORKS:
Previously flashing a kernel required it to be combined with ramdisk from a 
specific rom.
This will load ramdisk from phone, take it apart, replace the kernel, then
reflash it.
New modules can also be flashed to /system if needed.
